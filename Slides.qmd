## Teaching Statistics 1

#### Session 1a: Introduction to Probability

To get you thinking:

-   How would you explain randomness?

-   How would you define probability?

## What is your experience of teaching statistics content at A level?

-   A. I have never taught it

-   B. I have taught it for 1 or 2 years

-   C. I have taught for more than 2 years in total but not on a regular basis

-   D. I have taught it for more than 2 years on a regular basis

-   E. Other (tell us in the chat!)

## What strategy would you use?

*A lateral flow test has a specificity (true negative) of 99.97% and a sensitivity (true positive) of 70%. A PCR test has a specificity (true negative) of 100% and a sensitivity (true positive) of 95%.*

*Alix tests positive on a lateral flow test, but then she gets a negative PCR result. It is estimated that 4% of the population have covid. Does Alix have covid?*

## Aims of the session

::: incremental
-   To introduce our course tutors and the TS1 course area on Integral

-   To discuss and define randomness

-   To introduce probability using natural frequencies

::: {.column width="70%"}
"More about life, less about exam questions"

"More interactivity"

"More questions to deepen understanding, rather that just learning the processes to carry out"

"I would like to be confident in using technology in lessons and for technology to be a 'normal' part of A Level lessons."
